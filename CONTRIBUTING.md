## Development Workflow

- All code should be written in TypeScript and follow the project's code style.
- UI components are in `src/components/`.
- Pages are in `src/app/`.
- Use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) conventions.
- For styling, use Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- Test your changes locally before submitting a PR.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages. Example types:

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc)
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `test`: Adding or correcting tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

**Example:**

```markdown
feat: add user authentication system
fix: resolve navigation menu overflow issue
docs: update API documentation
style: format code according to style guide
refactor: simplify user profile component
test: add unit tests for data validation
chore: update dependencies
```

**Format:**
```markdown
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

---

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint configuration
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Prefer functional components with hooks
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep components small and focused

**TypeScript Guidelines:**
- Use strict mode
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper typing for all variables and functions
- Avoid `any` type when possible

**React/Next.js Guidelines:**
- Use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Follow Next.js file-based routing conventions
- Use proper error boundaries
- Implement proper loading states
